## Parkour
I have recently taken up the adrenaline inducing sport of parkour. I initially started this hobby to impress people on the internet, but have gotten so much more from it. I have become one with the physical world and will traverse it in the most efficient and dangerous way possible.

## Wide Spread Panic
I have opened my mind to the sound of the universe and it has led me to the jam band Wide Spread Panic. In my free time (I have a lot), I follow the band from city to city selling tie dye bandanas for dog parents, with part of the proceeds going to young adults who have been cut off from their trust fund. I haven't made enough to actually get into the show, but I'm getting pretty close.

## Sour Dough Bread
Like so many affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I too decided to invest a lot of time naming my sourdough bread starter. We chose the name of Drew because my girlfriend and I were really into The Handmaidâ€™s Tale at the time. I still haven't made any bread with it, but I'm sure it's fine, I've kept it in the back of my fridge for the past four years.
