In my free time (I have a lot), I follow the band from city to city selling tie dye bandanas for dog parents, with part of the proceeds going to young adults who have been cut off from their trust fund. I haven’t made enough to actually get into the show, but I’m getting pretty close."

We chose the name of Drew because my girlfriend and I were really into The Handmaid’s Tale at the time. I still haven’t made any bread with it, but I’m sure it’s fine, I’ve kept it in the back of my fridge for the past four years."
